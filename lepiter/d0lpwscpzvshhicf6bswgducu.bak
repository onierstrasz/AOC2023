Note that each tile has both a position in the grid, and two other tiles it connects to. Only the start position needs to figure out which tiles connect to it.\n\nWe parse the data into a grid of Tiles, each which knows its (x,y) position, its type, and the directions it leads to.\n\nWe can use a dictionary to map from pipes to (dx,dy) deltas.\nIn the second phase we build the Loop, starting from the Start Tile, and walk in both directions counting our steps, until we see a tile we have seen before.\n\n"
